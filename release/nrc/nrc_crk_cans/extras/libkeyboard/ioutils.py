    Sets up output based on command line arguments.

    If there is exactly one argument, that argument is assumed to be a
    filename to write output to.

    If no arguments are passed, then output is directed to stdout.

    This can also take an argument parser instance, and it will add an
    optional "outfile" positional argument.

    stdout is always opened in UTF-8, regardless of system settings. This is
    mostly only an issue in Windows, where the encoding often defaults to some
    weird CP12?? that is incompatible with Candian Aboriginal Syllabics ðŸ˜¡
